# Introduction:
- The Amwag (أمواج), from the Egyptian-arabic word for "waves”, it’s a project that seeks to transform our understanding of sustainable development. This initiative combines data from the [AQUASTAT portal](https://data.apps.fao.org/aquastat/?lang=en)( a fundamental source of information on water resources and management) to unravel the complexity surrounding water stress, GDP per capita, and the availability of safe drinking water in a certain country from 1964.

- This project was proposed as the final project of the Data Science boot camp from Spiced Academy (10.2023).

- Our main goals are: 
    I- To create an interactive website that can predict possible effects on targets by tweaking parameters.
             
    II- Make a presentation on correlations and clustering of countries based on water use habits.
