             This project was proposed as the final project of the Data Science boot camp from Spiced Academy (10.2023).
             
             #### Our main goals: 
            
             I- To create an interactive website that can predict possible effects on targets by tweaking parameters.
             
             II- Make a presentation on correlations and clustering of countries based on water use habits.
             
             #### Our main challenges:\n
             The project relies on AQUASTAT as its data source, and while AQUASTAT provides a wealth of data on water resources and agricultural water management, it encounters several challenges:\n
                
                - Lack of Complete Time-Series Data: \n
                     I - AQUASTAT's data often lacks complete time series, making it intricate to analyze trends and gain a comprehensive understanding of water's socioeconomic context. This limitation can curtail the scope of interpretation. \n
                     II - In the same category of problem, due to initiatives that are not computed in the data as social-political changes that could have happened locally, the data has a Non-stationarity behaviour meaning that the changes do not follow a stable pattern but mostly seem to admit a rather random progression in the given time frame. \n

                - Data Gaps: \n
                     Data gaps in AQUASTAT are mainly attributed to a lack of information and capacity at the national level. This increased the challenges in collecting comprehensive and accurate data for the training process. \n

                - Methodology Changes and Data Updates: \n
                     Frequent updates and changes in data methodology can render prior series invalid, leading to confusion and incorrect attribution of data to more recent years.

                - Inconsistent Terminology: \n
                     Discrepancies in terminology between countries and international organizations contribute to confusion and complicate data interpretation. For this reason, and also for a better understanding of the features used in this project,  please access the [ AQUASTAT glossary](https://www.fao.org/aquastat/en/databases/glossary/)\n
                     
                - We acknowledge these limitations and strives to ensure that data interpretation remain transparent and accounts for these constraints.\n

           The Amwag (ÿ£ŸÖŸàÿßÿ¨), from the Egyptian-arabic word for "waves‚Äù, it‚Äôs a project that seeks to transform our understanding of sustainable development. This initiative combines data from the [AQUASTAT portal](https://data.apps.fao.org/aquastat/?lang=en)( a fundamental source of information on water resources and management) to unravel the complexity surrounding water stress, GDP per capita, and the availability of safe drinking water in a certain country from 1964. 

            Water is the lifeblood of human civilization, influencing economic prosperity, social well-being, and environmental sustainability. Comprehending how to harmonize the crucial factors of water stress, economic growth, and public health is paramount in a world where 25 countries contend with extreme water stress annually, imperilling the lives and livelihoods of billions.
